# [](#header-1)Misinformation Detection: Data Reasoning in a Digital World


Based on the syllabus of [Carl T. Bergstrom](http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/) and [Jevin West](http://www.jevinwest.org/).

**Synopsis**: Our world is saturated with convincingly presented misinformation. Learn to detect and defuse it.

## [](#header-2)Learning Objectives

The learning objectives are straightforward. After taking the course, students should be able to:
Remain vigilant for misinformation contaminating their information diet.

* Recognize said misinformation whenever and wherever they encounter it.
* Figure out for themselves precisely why a particular bit of misinformation is misinformed.
* Provide a statistician or fellow scientist with a technical explanation of why a claim is misinformed.

The hope is that these skills will turn out to be among the most useful and most broadly applicable of those that students acquire during the course of their college education.

## [](#header-2)Schedule and readings

Each of the lectures will explore one specific facet of misinformation. For each week, a set of required readings are assigned. For some weeks, supplementary readings are also provided for those who wish to delve deeper.

### [](#header-3)Week 3. The natural ecology of misinformation. 
Where do we find misinformation? Why news media provide misinformation. TED talks and the marketplace for upscale misinformation. Why social media provide ideal conditions for the growth and spread of misinformation.

### [](#header-3)Week 4. Causality 
One common source of misinformation data analysis arises when people ignore, deliberately or otherwise, the fact that correlation is not causation. The consequences can be hilarious, but this confusion can also be used to mislead. Confusing causality with necessity or sufficiency. Regression to the mean pitched as treatment effect. Milton Friedman's thermostat. Selection masked as transformation.

### [](#header-3)Week 6. Data visualization. 
Data graphics can be powerful tools for understanding information, but they can also be powerful tools for misleading audiences. We explore the many ways that data graphics can steer viewers toward misleading conclusions.

### [](#header-3)Week 8. Publication bias. 
Even a community of competent scientists all acting in good faith can generate a misleading scholarly record when — as is the case in the current publishing environment — journals prefer to publish positive results over negative ones. In a provocative and hugely influential 2005 paper, epidemiologist John Ioannides went so far as to argue that this publication bias has created a situation in which most published scientific results are probably false. As a result, it’s not clear that one can safely rely on the results of some random study reported in the scientific literature, let alone on Buzzfeed. Once corporate funders with private agendas become involved, matters become all the more complicated.

### [](#header-3)Week 10. The ethics of calling bullshit. 
Where is the line between deserved criticism and targeted harassment? Is it, as one prominent scholar argued, “methodological terrorism” to call bullshit on a colleague's analysis? What if you use social media instead of a peer-reviewed journal to do so? How about calling bullshit on a whole field that you know almost nothing about? Pubpeer. Principles for the ethical calling of bullshit. The Dunning-Kruger effect. Differences between being a hard-minded skeptic and being a domineering jerk.

### [](#header-3)Week 11. Fake news. 
Fifteen years ago, nascent social media platforms offered the promise of a more democratic press through decentralized broadcasting and a decoupling of publishing from advertising revenue. Instead, we get sectarian echo chambers and, lately, a serious assault on the very notion of fact. Not only did fake news play a substantive role in the November 2016 US elections, but recently a fake news story actually provoked nuclear threats issued by twitter.

### [](#header-3)Week 12. Refuting misinformation. 
Refuting misinformation requires different approaches for different audiences. What works for a quantitatively-skilled professional scientist won't always convince your casually racist uncle on facebook, and vice versa.
